# Praca in≈ºynierska - program

### NOTES:
After first generation one of inputs change node type to HIDDEN. This cause problem with evaluation.

### TODO:
- [ ] NEAT - conventional
    - [ ] Change Evaluator to more conventional evolution algorithm
    - [ ] Look for package to drawing graphs (instead of genome printer)
    - [ ] Refactor utils to loop only once through nodes and connections
    - [ ] Create visualization of working NEAT (Species, Node and Connection structure etc.)
    - [ ] Connect with Neural Network to make decisions
    - [ ] Check on XOR that NEAT is working properly
    - [ ] Implement algorithm to FlappyBird
    - [ ] Implement algorithm to Sonic the Hedgehog
    - [ ] Add code documentation
- [ ] NEAT - new
    - [ ] Implement and test
