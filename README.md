# Praca in≈ºynierska - program

### TODO:
- [X] Innovation number generator (Probably this doesn't work)
- [X] Unit tests for structure mutations (nodes and connections)
- [X] Unit tests for crossover
- [X] Test somehow (maybe graphically) crossover function with matching connections
- [X] Count compatibility distance
- [ ] Test utils
- [ ] Refactor utils to loop only once through nodes and connections
- [X] Add evaluator (maybe Abstract Base Class)
  - [X] Place genomes into species
  - [X] Evaluate genomes and assign fitness
  - [X] Put best genomes from each species into next generation
  - [X] Breed the rest of the genomes
- [ ] Test evaluator
- [ ] Create visualization of working NEAT (Species, Node and Connection structure etc.)
- [ ] Connect with Neural Network to make decisions
- [ ] Check on XOR that NEAT is working properly
- [ ] Implement algorithm to FlappyBird
- [ ] Implement algorithm to Sonic the Hedgehog
